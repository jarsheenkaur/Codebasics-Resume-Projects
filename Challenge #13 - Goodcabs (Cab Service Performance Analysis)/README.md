# Goodcabs: Data-Driven Performance Analysis for Operational Growth & Passenger Satisfaction

- Built **interactive Power BI dashboards** using **Power Query** for **data transformation**, **DAX** for **KPI creation**, and **data modeling** to **establish structured relationships** between tables. **Extended analysis** beyond dashboard data by **exploring external market factors**, **uncovering deeper performance drivers to enable strategic, data-driven decision-making**. 
- **Performed ad-hoc analysis in MySQL**, **utilizing joins**, **CTEs**, **subqueries**, and **window functions** to **extract business-critical insights** from relational databases. 
- **Generated actionable recommendations** to **optimize operations**, **elevate service**, **maximize passenger satisfaction**, and **drive Goodcabs' market growth - positioning the company for long-term success** in India's competitive tier-2 mobility market.

## Project Features & Highlights

- **Demonstrates the full lifecycle** â€” from **business understanding** and **data loading** to **transformation**, **modeling**, **dashboarding**, and **actionable insights and recommendations**.
- Worked with **two structured databases** - **Trips** and **Targets**, featuring **multiple interconnected tables**. **Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query**, **built a fact-dimension model** and **resolved many-to-many joins**.
- **Designed five well-structured, purpose-driven dashboards** in **Power BI**, each **addressing a core business area** like operations, trips, passengers, revenue, and targets â€” **creating a 360Â° view of company performance**. **Built in interactivity** through **slicers**, **drilldowns**, and **navigations to enhance user experience**.
- **Created custom KPIs and calculated columns/measures** using **DAX** to **derive business-critical insights** such as **Repeat Passenger Rate**, **Customer Retention Rate**, **Target Achievement Rate**, etc.
- **Went beyond surface-level metrics** to **explore patterns and correlations** in retention, ratings, fares, etc. across cities and months. This **showed the true business story**, not just metric tracking.
- **Evaluated how actual performance aligned with city-wise and month-wise targets** for trips, passenger acquisition, and satisfaction ratings, **offering a clear view of gaps and achievements**.
- **Categorized cities based on business or tourism demand** and **compared them on performance metrics**, enabling **localized strategic insights tailored to city-specific dynamics**.
- Tracked **trends across six months** to identify **seasonal shifts**, **growth phases**, or **performance drops**.
- **Leveraged a wide range of Power BI visuals** (including unconventional ones) to **make the dashboards interactive, aesthetically appealing, and insight-rich** â€” far beyond basic cards and bars.
- Experimented with and successfully implemented **box plots**, **bubble plots**, **ribbon charts**, and **tornado charts** â€” **enhancing storytelling** and bringing out **complex relationships in a visually intuitive way**.
- **Combined data analysis with business logic** to deliver not just numbers, but **clear narratives** â€” **identifying whatâ€™s working, what needs attention, and how to improve**.
- **Delivered strategic recommendations tied to findings** â€” ranging from pricing and service improvements to retention tactics, marketing strategies, and partnerships, **ensuring business impact beyond the dashboards**.
- This project was **designed to demonstrate analytical depth**, not just report numbers. It **includes expected KPIs** and **dives into additional, derived insights** that often go unexplored in standard BI projects.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Trips** â€“ The total number of trips completed within the given period.  
2. **Total Fare (Revenue)** â€“ The total amount of fare collected from all trips during the period.  
3. **Total Distance Travelled** â€“ The cumulative distance covered across all trips.  
4. **Average Passenger Rating** â€“ The average rating given by passengers for their trips, measured on a scale of 1 to 10.  
5. **Average Driver Rating** â€“ The average rating given by drivers to passengers, measured on a scale of 1 to 10.  
6. **Average Fare per Trip** â€“ The average amount paid per trip, calculated as total fare divided by total trips.  
7. **Average Fare per km** â€“ The average fare charged per kilometre, calculated as total fare divided by total distance travelled.  
8. **Average Trip Distance** â€“ The average distance covered per trip, calculated as total distance travelled divided by total trips.  
9. **Trip Distance (Max, Min)** â€“ The longest and shortest trip distances recorded within the given period.  
10. **New Trips** â€“ The number of trips taken by first-time passengers.  
11. **Repeat Trips** â€“ The number of trips taken by returning passengers.  
12. **Total Passengers** â€“ The total count of passengers who booked at least one trip within the given period, including both new and repeat passengers.
13. **New Passengers** â€“ The number of passengers taking their first ride with Goodcabs.  
14. **Repeat Passengers** â€“ The number of passengers who have taken at least one trip in previous months and returned for another ride.  
15. **New vs. Repeat Trips Ratio** â€“ The ratio of new trips to repeat trips, indicating the balance between first-time and returning customers.  
16. **Repeat Passenger Rate (%)** â€“ The percentage of total passengers who are repeat customers, calculated as repeat passengers divided by total passengers.  
17. **MoM Growth Rate** â€“ The month-over-month growth in key metrics like trips, revenue, or passengers, indicating business expansion or contraction trends.  
18. **Target Achievement Rate** â€“ The percentage of actual performance achieved against set targets for trips, new passengers, and ratings.  
19. **Customer Retention Rate** â€“ The percentage of previous passengers who returned for another ride.  
20. **New vs. Repeat Passengers Ratio** â€“ The proportion of new passengers compared to repeat passengers.
